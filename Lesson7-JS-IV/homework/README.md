# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - an object can be compared to objects in the real world as they have properties just like real world object.

	* Properties - describe the object and its characteristics.

	* Methods - Are functions inside of objects.

	* for in loop - Are used to loop object keys (properties).

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - Dot notation is used to access properties and to add them to an object. Dot notation assigned properties have to be valid javascript identifiers but bracket notation assinged properties do not have to be valid js identifiers because they are strings. 

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
