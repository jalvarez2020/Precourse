# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `prototype` : Every object in javascript gets their properties and methods from a prototype. This is useful if you need to add a method or property to only a certain type of object instead of manually coding it into each object individually. 

	* Constructors : Are used to create objects of the same type without having to code each new object individually. This is very useful when having to create many objects of the same type in large quantities. Constructors are often called CLASSES.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSV` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
